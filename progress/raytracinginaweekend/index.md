title: Raytracing in One Weekend Project
summary: A very simple ray tracer based on the first book of the [Raytracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series. Although it works, it's pretty slow because it runs on the CPU... maybe... just maybe... some improvements will be made in the future.
